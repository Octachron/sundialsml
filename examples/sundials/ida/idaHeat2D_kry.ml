 * -----------------------------------------------------------------
 * Example problem for IDA: 2D heat equation, serial, GMRES.
 *
 * This example solves a discretized 2D heat equation problem.
 * This version uses the Krylov solver IDASpgmr.
 *
 * The DAE system solved is a spatial discretization of the PDE
 *          du/dt = d^2u/dx^2 + d^2u/dy^2
 * on the unit square. The boundary condition is u = 0 on all edges.
 * Initial conditions are given by u = 16 x (1 - x) y (1 - y). The
 * PDE is treated with central differences on a uniform M x M grid.
 * The values of u at the interior points satisfy ODEs, and
 * equations u = 0 at the boundaries are appended, to form a DAE
 * system of size N = M^2. Here M = 10.
 *
 * The system is solved with IDA using the Krylov linear solver
 * IDASPGMR. The preconditioner uses the diagonal elements of the
 * Jacobian only. Routines for preconditioning, required by
 * IDASPGMR, are supplied here. The constraints u >= 0 are posed
 * for all components. Output is taken at t = 0, .01, .02, .04,
 * ..., 10.24. Two cases are run -- with the Gram-Schmidt type
 * being Modified in the first case, and Classical in the second.
 * The second run uses IDAReInit and IDAReInitSpgmr.
