Sundials IDA examples in OCaml
--------------------------------
This directory contains all of the Sundials IDA examples from the original
distribution recoded in OCaml. For the most part these examples have been
translated directly into an imperative OCaml style.

The examples can be compiled and their output compared with that of the
original examples by running:
    make tests.log; cat tests.log

and if the libraries have been compiled with LAPACK support:
    make lapack-tests.log

Their output may differ from that of the OCaml versions depending on several
compilation options that affect the precision of floating point
calculations. There is an excellent description of the general issues at:
    http://www.christian-seiler.de/projekte/fpmath/

Unlike the CVODE bindings, the precision issues of the IDA binding is not yet
investigated.
