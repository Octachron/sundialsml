(** Define abstract NVectors using imperative or functional operations

  The Sundials solvers are written in a data-independent manner. They all
  operate on generic vectors through a set of operations defined by the
  particular {!nvector} implementation. The {!Cvode_nvector} module operates on
  abstract nvectors.

  The Ocaml interface provides two ways to define generic nvectors: either
  through a set of (imperative) operations on an underlying {!Mutable} data
  type, or a set of (functional) operations on an underlying {!Immutable} data
  type. A set of {!Immutable} operations is converted into a set of {!Mutable}
  ones, which can be used with a solver, by {!Immutable.from_immutable} which
  introduces a reference in the underlying data type and modifies the set of
  operations to update it in-place.
