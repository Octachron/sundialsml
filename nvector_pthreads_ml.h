/* OCaml interface to Pthreads NVectors.

   See the comments in nvector_ml.h for the interfacing principles common to
   all NVectors.

   Pthreads nvectors
   -----------------
   The payload is a Bigarray.

   The N_Vector content->data field points to the data in the C heap which
   underlies the payload Bigarray.

   The N_Vector ops are identical to those of a standard Pthreads N_Vector,
   except for nvclone, nvcloneempty, and nvdestroy which are functions,
   implemented in nvector_ml.c, to create the arrangement described here.
