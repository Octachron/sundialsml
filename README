The C sides of the cvode solver interface are split into two parts:
functions that are independent of nvectors (cvode_ml.c), and functions that
depend on nvectors (cvode_ml_nvec.c). The latter are compiled twice, once
with -DCVODE_ML_BIGARRAYS to produce code that works with Bigarrays as
nvectors (to be called from Cvode_serial), and once without to produce code
that works with abstract nvectors (to be called from Cvode_nvector).

The C sides of the ida solver interface are split into two parts: functions
that are independent of nvectors (ida_ml.c), and functions that depend on
nvectors (cvode_ml_nvec.h). The latter are compiled twice, once with
-DIDA_ML_BIGARRAYS to produce code that works with Bigarrays as nvectors (to
be called from Ida_serial), and once without to produce code that works with
abstract nvectors (to be called from Ida_nvector).
