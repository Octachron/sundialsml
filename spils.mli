(** Performs a QR factorization of a Hessenberg matrix.
    The call [qr_fact h q newjob], where [h] is the [n+1] by [n]
    Hessenberg matrix (stored row-wise), [q] stores the computed Givens
    rotation, and [newjob=false] indicates that the first [n-1] columns of
    [h] have already been factored. The computed Givens rotation has the form
    {% $\begin{bmatrix} c & -s \\ s & c \end{bmatrix}$ %}. It is stored in
    the [2n] elements of [q] as [[|c; s; c; s; ...; c; s|]].

(** Solve the linear least squares problem. In
    [qr_sol h q b], [h] and [q] are, respectively, the upper triangular
    factor $R$ of the original Hessenberg matrix and [Q] the Givens
    rotations used to factor itâ€”both computed by {!qr_fact}. The function
    computes the [n+1] elements of [b] to solve $Rx = Qb$.

  [v.{k-1}], [v.{k-2}], ..., [v.{k-p}].
  The matrix [h] must be allocated row-wise so that the [(i,j)]th entry is

  vector. *)
