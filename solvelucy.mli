 * Prototype solver for hybrid-lucy programs compiled to a single function.
 * Implements both the 'delta-step' semantics (run_delta), i.e. instantaneous
 * loop on new zero-crossings in the discrete step, and the 'synchronous'
 * semantics (run_synchronous), i.e. a single execution at each discrete step.

(* The mode is determined by:
 *   init = true --> mode == Init
 *   init = false && forall i. roots[i] == false --> mode == Continuous
 *   init = false && exists i. roots[i] == true  --> mode == Discrete
 *
 * In brief, by mode:
 *
 * mode == Init
 *      calculate: y
 *
 * mode == Discrete
 *      using: rin
 *      calculate: y, rout
 *      return: true (to continue) or false (to terminate)
 *
 * mode == Continuous
 *      using: y
 *      calculate: der, rout
