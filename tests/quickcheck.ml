    updated with information about the new value.  [seed] is the initial value

(** Shrink a list of values while maintaining an invariant that can be checked

    {[shrink_1pass_list shrink fixup seed xs]} assumes [shrink] and [fixup] are
    purely functional.  It must be the case that [xs] is one of the lists that
    can be produced by [gen_1pass_list gen seed] using the same [seed] and some
    impure function [gen]; the shrunk lists will also be such lists.

    [shrink] is a function that shrinks one element of the list.  [shrink s x]
    should produce some or all of the possible return values of [gen s] whose
    [snd]'s are "smaller" than [x].

    [fixup] is used when an element of the list is shrunk.  Its job is to
    update all subsequent elements and restore the invariant if it is broken.
    [fixup s x] should produce one of the possible return values of [gen s].
    The [snd] of the return value need not be "smaller" than [x], but it should
    be equal to [x] whenever possible (i.e. it should return [x] as-is if it
    already satisfies the invariant).  Unlike [gen], [fixup] can (and probably
    should) be purely functional.

    Currently, [shrink_1pass_list] enumerates lists produced by the following
    procedure: either drop an element of the list or replace it by a smaller
    value produced by [shrink]; then pass [fixup] through the whole list to
    restore any invariants broken by shrinking.
