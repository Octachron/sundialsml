This directory contains tests that expose bugs in sundials (the C version from
LLNL).  Quickcheck generally works around those bugs by just not generating
programs that trigger them, but we'd like to keep these here for our records.


Additional gotchas:

* [sundials 2.5.0] reinit doesn't clear stop time

In IDA and CVODE, the only way to clear the stop time, once set, is to
integrate past it.  In CVODE, the bug explained in cvode_stop_time.ml compounds
this problem: if you set a stop time, you have to either integrate past that
time before doing a reinit, or you must reinit to a time before the stop time.
