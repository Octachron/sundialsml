(** Generic linear solvers: shared definitions.

    Sundials provides a set of functions for instantiating linear solvers from
    two families: {!module:Direct} and {!module:Iterative}. Any instance may
    be associated with at most one solver session.

(** {2:exceptions Exceptions} *)

(** Raised on an unrecoverable failure in a linear solver. The argument is
    [true] for a recoverable failure and [false] for an unrecoverable one.
    {cconst SUNLS_PACKAGE_FAIL_REC/_UNREC} *)
exception UnrecoverableFailure of bool

(** Raised when creating a linear solver if the given matrix is not square. *)
exception MatrixNotSquare

(** Raised on an attempt to associate a linear solver instance with more than
    one session. *)
exception SolverInUse

(** Indicates failure of an atimes function. The argument is [true] for a
    recoverable failure and [false] for an unrecoverable one.
    {cconst SUNLS_ATIMES_FAIL_REC/_UNREC} *)
exception ATimesFailure of bool

(** Indicates failure of a preconditioner setup routine. The argument is
    [true] for a recoverable failure and [false] for an unrecoverable one.
    {cconst SUNLS_PSET_FAIL_REC/_UNREC} *)
exception PSetFailure of bool

(** Indicates failure of a preconditioner solver. The argument is [true] for a
    recoverable failure and [false] for an unrecoverable one.
    {cconst SUNLS_PSOLVE_FAIL_REC/_UNREC} *)
exception PSolveFailure of bool

(** Indicates failure of a Gram-Schmidt routine. {cconst SUNLS_GS_FAIL} *)
exception GSFailure

(** Indicates that the QR solution found a singular result.
    {cconst SUNLS_QRSOL_FAIL} *)
exception QRSolFailure

(** Indicates that the residual is reduced but without convergence to the
    desired tolerance. {cconst SUNLS_RES_REDUCED} *)
exception ResReduced

(** Indicates that a solver failed to converge. {cconst SUNLS_CONV_FAIL} *)
exception ConvFailure

(** Indicates that QR factorization encountered a singular matrix.
    {cconst SUNLS_QRFACT_FAIL} *)
exception QRfactFailure

(** Indicates that LU factorization encountered a singular matrix.
    {cconst SUNLS_LUFACT_FAIL} *)
exception LUfactFailure

(** Indicates failure in an external linear solver package. The argument
    is [true] for a recoverable failure and [false] for an unrecoverable one.
    {cconst SUNLS_PACKAGE_FAIL_REC/_UNREC} *)
exception PackageFailure of bool

(** Raised by {!Iterative.set_prec_type} if the given type is not allowed. *)
exception IllegalPrecType

(** Indicates that an internal callback, identified by the first argument,
    returned the given unknown error code. *)
exception InternalFailure of (string * int)
