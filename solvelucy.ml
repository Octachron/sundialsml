(* TODO:
   - Think harder about the interface between simulation code and the external
     world?
     
     For instance, if a discrete node calls a function to get the mouse
     position, and there are multiple Discrete iterations at an instant, is it
     important to hold this value constant (which may be expensive, in terms of
     memory, and complicated), or just let it make multiple calls?

     Worse, what about a destructive input, like reading bytes from a file; it
     should probably only read one value regardless of the number of
     zero-crossing iterations.

     Even more so for outputs and state changes.

   - Do we need a special zero-crossing to mark when external inputs have
     occurred?
     Or are they sampled against an internal clock; i.e. does the discrete
     program have to specify a sampling rate.
 *)


(*
   XXX Notes to Tim:
   - There is no difference between continuous outputs and continuous states (Moore = Mealy)
   - But there is a difference between discrete outputs and discrete states (Moore /= Mealy)
     and, in fact, last memories conflate the two.
     whereas flows do not.

   - It should be a piece of cake to reimplement the Argos in Simulink model
     using hybrid lucid synchrone.
