Sundials/ML 2.5.0p0
-------------------
Sundials/ML v2.5.0p0 is an OCaml interface to v2.5.0 of the Sundials suite
of numerical solvers (CVODE, CVODES, IDA, IDAS, KINSOL).

It requires OCaml 3.12.1 or greater, Sundials 2.5.0, and optionally
OCamlMPI 1.01.

* When building Sundials manually, we recommend applying the
  `sundials-2.5.0.patch` file and building with examples and shared library
  support:

      patch -p1 < path/to/sundials-2.5.0.patch
      ./configure --enable-examples --enable-shared

  Sundials/ML will function correctly if the patch is not applied, but some
  examples will fail with incorrect results.

* The backward preconditioner, banded and dense jacobian, and jacobian
  times vector callbacks in Cvodes.Adjoint and Idas.Adjoint do not function
  correctly due to an issue in the underlying C library.
