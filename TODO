GOAL: End november:
* Sent for APP.
* Available on Github.
* Released on OPAM 

Priorities: Jun
---------------
1.  Replace long lists of callback arguments with records, carefully
    adapting the docs.

Priorities: Tim
---------------
1. Docs:
   - Add links to download from github (.tar.gz from branch).
   - Where to put the docs online?
     sundialsml/current/index.html
     sundialsml/2.5.0p0/index.html

Decisions
---------
* Makefiles will be used for the build system; though we will try to
  simplify and improve them.

* Name and version numbering: Sundials/ML 2.6.0
  first version: Sundials/ML 2.6.0
  first patch:   Sundials/ML 2.6.0p1
  second patch:  Sundials/ML 2.6.0p2

  Have everything working for 2.5.0 (and include a patch file for the
  Sundials source), but make the first official release for 2.6.0.

MINOR PATCHES
-------------
1. Rename CAML_FN everywhere?

2. Alternate linear solvers for Cvodes.Adjoint and Idas.Adjoint (with
   examples)?
