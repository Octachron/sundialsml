GOAL: End november:
* Sent for APP.
* Available on Github.
* Released on OPAM 

Priorities: Jun
---------------

1.  Replace long lists of callback arguments with records, carefully
    adapting the docs.

2. Fix the warning messages
    ../../examples.mk:298: *** mixed implicit and normal rules: deprecated syntax
    ../../examples.mk:298: *** mixed implicit and normal rules: deprecated syntax

3. Write skeleton programs.

Priorities: Tim
---------------

1. Docs: break long functions into lines.

2. Understand/fix remaining slower examples.

3. Add Sundials_config.safe test to Dls/Spils checks.

4. Opam, working at toplevel.

5. Fix configure so that it finds ocamlmpi correctly even with multiple
   ocaml versions in opam:

   opam switch 3.12.1		    opam switch 4.0.1
   ./configure --enable-mpi	    ./configure --enable-mpi


Issues/Remaining questions
--------------------------
* What to do about the 'tests/' subdirectory?

Decisions
---------
* Makefiles will be used for the build system; though we will try to
  simplify and improve them.

* Name and version numbering: Sundials/ML 2.6.0
  first version: Sundials/ML 2.6.0
  first patch:   Sundials/ML 2.6.0p1
  second patch:  Sundials/ML 2.6.0p2

  Have everything working for 2.5.0 (and include a patch file for the
  Sundials source), but make the first official release for 2.6.0.

MINOR PATCHES
-------------
1. Flatten out jacobian_arg

2. Rename CAML_FN everywhere?

3. Alternate linear solvers for Cvodes.Adjoint and Idas.Adjoint (with
   examples)?
