Decisions
---------
* Makefiles will be used for the build system; though we will try to
  simplify and improve them.

* Name and version numbering: Sundials/ML 2.6.0
  first version: Sundials/ML 2.6.0
  first patch:   Sundials/ML 2.6.0p1
  second patch:  Sundials/ML 2.6.0p2

  Have everything working for 2.5.0 (and include a patch file for the
  Sundials source), but make the first official release for 2.6.0.

TODO
----
1. Replace long lists of callback arguments with records.
   And carefully adapt the docs.

2. Test under OCaml 3.12.x.

3. Performance issues/tests:
   - Try to have all examples within 2xC (with the possible exception of
     cvode/serial/cvRoberts_dns_uw_alt).

   - Bigarray allocation in root function callbacks.
     Try including a bigarray 'shell' (of int32s) in the session structure,
     as per CVODES/IDAS to avoid allocating at each call.

4. (Jun) OPAM/findlib wrappers.
   - Everything properly supported in a toplevel

5. (Tim) Fix, simplify, and generally tidy up all doc comments. Write the
   missing documentation and rewrite intro.doc.

   Tidy up the documentation; in particular, add @raise tags for functions
   that raise exceptions (like get_dky... )
   Document the ones that correspond to return values mentioned in their
   user guide.  (Or otherwise that are deemed important.)

   Generated text and pdf?
   Automatically check links?
   Break long function types into lines?
   Fix the skeleton programs.
   Check that there are no undescribed index entries.
   In Cvodes, change all Cvodes.session to Cvode.session?

   To explain:
   - Check the various links (@cvode, @cvodes, @ida, @idas, etc.)
     (automatically with a script?)

6. (Tim) Eventual release:
   - Test against OCaml 3.12.x (document in intro.doc, update configure)
   - DÃªpot APP.
   - Repository on Github.
   - Release on Opam.
   - Announce on OCaml and Sundials lists.

MINOR PATCHES
-------------
1. Flatten out jacobian_arg

2. Rename CAML_FN everywhere?

3. Add tests for Spils.qr_fact/qr_sol/modified_gs/classical_gs to
   examples/ocaml/linear.

4. Alternate linear solvers for Cvodes.Adjoint and Idas.Adjoint (with
   examples)?

5. Inlude MathJax code in doc folder for offline use?
