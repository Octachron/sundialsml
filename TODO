* Makefiles will be used for the build system; though we will try to
  simplify and improve them.

TODO
----

DONE 1. (Tim) Change the copyright headers:
   - OCaml interface to (serial) Sundials.
   - Copyright 2014...

DONE 2. (Tim) Tidy up and complete the linear solver interface:
   - Spils
   - Smoother integration with CVODE and IDA.
   - Add tests / examples (from Sundials?)

DONE 3. (Tim) Interface to KINSOL.
   - Write the interface.
   - Adapt examples from Sundials.

DONE 4. (Tim) Doc generation to work for both OCaml 3.12 and 4.x.

DONE 5. (Tim) Interface to CVODES with maximal reuse and minimal copy-paste

DONE 6. (Tim) Rework the nvector interface and eliminate code duplication.

DONE 7. (Tim) Interface the Alternate Linear Solver Modules
   http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/documentation/cv_guide/node8.html

DONE 8. (Tim) Interface with Parallel NVectors

9. (Jun) Interface to IDAS with maximal reuse and minimal copy-paste
    - adapt for parallel nvector changes
    - add alternate linear solver modules
    - add BDD solver.
    - ensure consistency with recent changes cvode/cvodes.

DONE 10. (Jun) Ensure that all examples are implemented.
    Add the missing parallel examples for cvode, cvodes, kinsol, ida, idas. 

10. (Jun) Add a perf.log target (like tests.log) to each examples
    subdirectory. Run each binary (both C and opt and byte) 10 times and
    take the average wall clock time. Generate a table with three columns
    (original, .opt, .byte) and one number in each.
    gnuplot with C time normalized.

    Profile some badly performing examples.

    Compare to the same examples in pySUNDIALS or python-sundials?

11. (Jun) OPAM/findlib wrappers.
   - Everything properly supported in a toplevel

DONE 13. (Tim) Parallel CVODES and KINSOL examples.

14. (Tim) Fix, simplify, and generally tidy up all doc comments. Write the
    missing documentation and rewrite intro.doc.

15. (Tim) Eventual release:
   - DÃªpot APP.
   - Repository on Github.
   - Release on Opam.
   - Announce on OCaml and Sundials lists.

16. Versioning scheme
   - 2.6.0-0  where 0 is binding's version
     (clashes with Debian patch levels)
   - 2.6.0ml1 where 1 is binding's version

MINOR PATCHES
-------------
2. (Tim/Jun) Add the Dls functions to Cvodes/Idas:
     set_dense_jac_fn
     clear_dense_jac_fn
     set_band_jac_fn
     clear_band_jac_fn
   and the Spils functions:
     set_preconditioner
     set_jac_times_vec_fn
     clear_jac_times_vec_fn

   and just provide a reinit function.

   In the doc, mention that these don't reset performance counters.
   But they're discouraged otherwise.

4. Tidy up the documentation; in particular, add @raise tags for functions
   that raise exceptions (like get_dky... )

   Document the ones that correspond to return values mentioned in
   their user guide.  (Or otherwise that are deemed important.)

DONE 5. Rename Carray to Realarray?
DONE 6. Rename create functions to make?

7. Using spgmr linear solver with prec_setup = None and prec_solve = Some
   crashes.

8. Check that Callback.register "" are consistent with C code.

9. Flatten out jacobian

TO DISCUSS
----------
* Should we check consistency of vector lengths?

  - To do this generically, we need a new function in nvector_*.ml to compare
    array lengths.

  - C-implemented comparator as third field of nvector type.  Provide
    NULL for custom nvectors (which will be implemented in OCaml so
    are safe anyway).

  - unify CHECK_MATRIX_ACCESS with SAFETY_CHECKS

TO EXPLAIN IN DOCS
------------------
* Possibility to 'break' Sundials by passing nvectors of an incompatible
  size (e.g., Cvode.init with an nvector of size 10 and reinit with one of
  size 5).
* Check the various links (@cvode, @cvodes, @ida, @idas, etc.)
  (automatically with a script?)
