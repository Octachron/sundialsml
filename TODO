GOAL: End november:
* Sent for APP.
* Available on Github.
* Released on OPAM 

Priorities: Jun
---------------
1. Jun: Replace long lists of callback arguments with records,
	carefully adapting the docs.

2. Jun: Fix the warning messages
    ../../examples.mk:298: *** mixed implicit and normal rules: deprecated syntax
    ../../examples.mk:298: *** mixed implicit and normal rules: deprecated syntax

3. Jun/Tim: Write skeleton programs.

Priorities: Tim
---------------

1. Tim: Docs: break long functions into lines.

2. Tim: Understand/fix remaining slower examples.

Decisions
---------
* Makefiles will be used for the build system; though we will try to
  simplify and improve them.

* Name and version numbering: Sundials/ML 2.6.0
  first version: Sundials/ML 2.6.0
  first patch:   Sundials/ML 2.6.0p1
  second patch:  Sundials/ML 2.6.0p2

  Have everything working for 2.5.0 (and include a patch file for the
  Sundials source), but make the first official release for 2.6.0.

TODO
----
2. Test under OCaml 3.12.x.

3. Performance issues/tests:
   - Try to have all examples within 2xC (with the possible exception of
     cvode/serial/cvRoberts_dns_uw_alt).

   - Bigarray allocation in root function callbacks.
     Try including a bigarray 'shell' (of int32s) in the session structure,
     as per CVODES/IDAS to avoid allocating at each call.

4. (Jun) OPAM/findlib wrappers.
   - Everything properly supported in a toplevel

5. (Tim) Docmentation:
   Break long function types into lines?
   Fix the skeleton programs.

6. (Tim) Eventual release:
   - Test against OCaml 3.12.x (document in intro.doc, update configure)
   - DÃªpot APP.
   - Repository on Github.
   - Release on Opam.
   - Announce on OCaml and Sundials lists.

MINOR PATCHES
-------------
1. Flatten out jacobian_arg

2. Rename CAML_FN everywhere?

3. Add tests for Spils.qr_fact/qr_sol/modified_gs/classical_gs to
   examples/ocaml/linear.

4. Alternate linear solvers for Cvodes.Adjoint and Idas.Adjoint (with
   examples)?
