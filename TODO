    adapting the docs.

    ../../examples.mk:298: *** mixed implicit and normal rules: deprecated syntax
    ../../examples.mk:298: *** mixed implicit and normal rules: deprecated syntax

Priorities: Tim

1. Understand/fix remaining slower examples.

2. Opam, working at toplevel.

Issues/Remaining questions
--------------------------
* What to do about the 'tests/' subdirectory?

Decisions
---------
* Makefiles will be used for the build system; though we will try to
  simplify and improve them.

* Name and version numbering: Sundials/ML 2.6.0
  first version: Sundials/ML 2.6.0
  first patch:   Sundials/ML 2.6.0p1
  second patch:  Sundials/ML 2.6.0p2

  Have everything working for 2.5.0 (and include a patch file for the
  Sundials source), but make the first official release for 2.6.0.

MINOR PATCHES
-------------
1. Flatten out jacobian_arg

2. Rename CAML_FN everywhere?

3. Alternate linear solvers for Cvodes.Adjoint and Idas.Adjoint (with
   examples)?
